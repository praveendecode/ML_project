# House Rent Prediction


# Overview

- Predict rental prices for residential properties using a data-driven model. The project focuses on providing accurate and reliable rent predictions based on historical rental data and property attributes.

# Problem Statement

- Determining appropriate rental prices is crucial for property owners, tenants, and property management companies. Accurate rent predictions help landlords set competitive prices, tenants make informed decisions, and property managers optimize portfolio management.

# Main Features

   ## Data Preparation:
  - Imputation of missing values.
    - Feature engineering and addition of new features.
      -  Data type conversion and encoding of categorical variables.

    ## Machine Learning Model:
      -  Model selection and hyperparameter tuning using PyCaret.
       - Evaluation of model interpretability and feature importance.
        - Finalization and saving of the trained model.

   ##  Prediction:
  - Usage of the trained model to predict rental prices on new data.
 - Saving and loading of the model for future use.
   -  Evaluation of model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
